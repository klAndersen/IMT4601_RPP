\section{Desired/necessary knowledge}
\label{chapter5:desired_knowledge}
The following list is a short summary of the knowledge needed to ensure completion of the master thesis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand how the Open Edx system works
	\item Understand how the StackExchange API (and community) works
	\item Be able to create an functional hybrid algorithm based on \gls{hmm} and \gls{bn} that can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Convert user input to a query format
		\item Be able to communicate with external resources (e.g. WordNET, StackExchange)
		\item Be able to use this query format to retrieve data from the StackExchange community site
		\item Process the retrieved data to only select the results that are relevant for the user
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
	\item 
	\item 
	\item 
\end{itemize}

%% update this part after experiment is conducted
\emph{This part will be updated after user testing:} \\
To get an early start, a prototype was developed in the course IMT5251 Advanced Project Work. To also have the ability to get user feedback and check if the current survey is good enough, students from the 1. and 2. year learning programming at \gls{guc} were invited to test the prototype\ldots 

\section{Produced deliverables}
\label{chapter5:produced_deliverables}

What deliverables are to be produced (MSc thesis report, software,...)

For each of the activities identified, specify \\
	1. the time you need to complete each activity both calendar time and 'man-hours'.  \\
	2. hours needed by you \\ 
	3. things you need to buy (consumables) \\
	4. equipment, lab space or facilities you need access to \\
	5. contributions from others (e.g. survey/interview participants) and how much each will have to contribute in terms of resources (probably time)

\section{Availability of deliverables}
\label{chapter5:availability_deliverables}

When are the various deliverables going to be available?
