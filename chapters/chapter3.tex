\section{Comparison of \glsentrylong{ir} (\glsentryshort{ir}) when using Chat Agents and Search engines}
\label{chapter3:chatbot_vs_search_engine}
%% user experience with chatbots vs. search engines
I could not find anything in relation to this topic on the following sites:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \url{http://dblp.uni-trier.de/}
	\item \url{http://link.springer.com/}
	\item \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/}
	\item \url{http://www.sciencedirect.com/}
	\item \url{http://dl.acm.org/}
\end{itemize}
The following is a list of the keyword searches that were made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 'chatbot vs search engine'
	\item 'chatbot and search engine'
	\item 'comparison of chatbot and search engine'
	\item 'evaluation of retrieval systems' 
\end{itemize}
The reason for this might be related to the fact that search engines are able to 
retrieve all sorts of information from numerous documents and web-sites, whereas ChatBots are usually made for light conversation or for specific 
topics and purposes. The research question that this is related to (Research question \ref{res_q1}) is more on the qualitative side, ie. will the 
users continue to use the search engine, or would they switch to the Chat Agent?
