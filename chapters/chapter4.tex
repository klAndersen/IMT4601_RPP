\section{Hyptotheses and variables}
\label{chapter4:hypotheses_variables}
In this section, I will attempt to identify the hypotheses and variables relevant for my Master thesis. The following Hypotheses are based on the research questions, 
and is an attempt to identify the possible outcomes of my research.
\begin{itemize}
	\item H0: The Chat Agent will have no effect on neither the students knowledge, 
	or the students ability to phrase good questions.
	\item H1: The Chat Agent will have no effect on the students knowledge, 
	but the students will be better at phrasing good questions.
	\item H2: The Chat Agent will have an effect on the students knowledge, 
	but not on the students ability to phrase good questions.
	\item H3: The Chat Agent will improve both the knowledge 
	and the students ability to to phrase good questions.
\end{itemize}
The threats to the causality in my thesis is mostly the students maturity. In the beginning they may have little to no knowledge, but as they are coming closer to 
the end of the Spring semester, they will have acquired more understanding and knowledge on the given subjects. Their improvement in asking questions can also be 
affected by their supervisors (e.g. through the iterative process of asking questions, they learn to be more specific when asking for help). Previous knowledge from 
before the Bachelor started can also have an impact. Students with background in programming, be it self-taught or through work may know the basics, but its first 
at the end of the course they can put all the pieces together (the third variable problem). 

\section{Survey and Interview}
\label{chapter4:survey_and_interview}
To identify such underlying issues, everyone in the classes that participate will be given surveys to fill out during the thesis. The goal of this survey is to try 
to find out if there is a correlation between the use of the Chat Agent and the knowledge acquired at the end of the semester. The survey will ask them questions 
related to their current knowledge level and what experience, if any, they have from before. It is also necessary to find out in what way the different students learn, 
e.g. by using Fleming's VARK questionnaire\footnote{\url{http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/?p=questionnaire}} (used in \cite[p.~152]{Kowalski2013}). This way, 
I can also try to see if there is a correlation between those that are of the type read/write and their grades at the end.

It would also be necessary to conduct interviews with participants, to see if there are any issues or variables that the survey has not picked up. \\

\section{A/B testing as an experimental method}
\label{chapter4:ab_testing_experimental}
\emph{just quick notes to give you an idea whats to be written here} \\
I'm thinking semi-quasi experiment with randomized selection, so that the selection is not biased in relation to previous knowledge and desired learning outcome of 
given students

\section{\glsentrylong{qa} (\glsentryshort{qa}) model}
\label{chapter4:qa_model}
\emph{just quick notes to give you an idea whats to be written here} \\
e.g. qualitative analysis of the students view on their own ability to ask questions, analysis of the question progress stored, perhaps something about 

\section{Quantitative comparison of the students results}
\label{chapter4:quantitative_comparison}
\emph{just quick notes to give you an idea whats to be written here} \\
comparing the results of all students, to see if those that used the chat agent had better (or greater improvement) in their grades at the end
